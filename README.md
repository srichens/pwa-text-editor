## Bootcamp Week 19 Challenge
This week's challenge was to refactor starter code to build a single-page text editor that runs in the browser, meets PWA criteria, includes data persistance for redundancy, and also functions offline. The requirements included the following:

1. Use IndexedDB to store and get data.
2. Bundle the JavaScript files using webpack.
3. Generate a manifest file from the webpack.
4. Use workbox to create a service work that caches assets.
5. Ensure the application works offline and can be installed as a PWA.

## Installation
This app is deployed on Heroku, so it can be used solely in the browser. But if run from the command line, it requires Node.js, npm, Express.js, and idb.

## Usage
1. From the command line, run npm i && npm start, and then open the indicated port in the browser.
2. When in the application on the browser through Heroku or the cli command, click on the body of the text editor to type notes.
3. Click off the text editor body and refresh the page - your notes will persist.
